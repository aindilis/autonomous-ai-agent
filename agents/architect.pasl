%% What are some functions that one would expect of a program that
%% curates software and resources to build AI? The system is called
%% Architect, and it has vast libraries full of software systems,
%% ready to be packged, or already packaged.

%% Computing result and adding to cache

%% 1. Software Recommendations: Architect should provide personalized
%% recommendations for AI software and resources based on the user's
%% requirements and past usage patterns.

%% 2. Package Management: Architect should offer easy package
%% management tools to facilitate the installation and maintenance of
%% AI software packages and libraries.

%% 3. Dependency Analysis: Architect should perform a comprehensive
%% analysis of dependencies between different software components to
%% ensure seamless integration and reduce compatibility issues.

%% 4. Version Control: Architect should provide version control tools
%% to manage different versions of software packages and libraries,
%% allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed.

%% 5. Integration Capabilities: Architect should be able to integrate
%% AI software with various other systems and technologies, such as
%% machine learning frameworks, data storage systems, and cloud
%% platforms.

%% 6. Resource Management: Architect should offer tools to manage the
%% allocation of computing resources, such as CPU, memory, and GPU,
%% for AI tasks.

%% 7. Performance Monitoring: Architect should monitor the performance
%% of AI applications and identify bottlenecks or areas for
%% improvement.

%% 8. Security and Compliance: Architect should ensure the security
%% and compliance of AI software packages and libraries with relevant
%% regulations and industry standards.

%% 9. User Management: Architect should offer user management
%% capabilities to create, manage, and grant access to different roles
%% and permissions within the system.

%% 10. Documentation and Training: Architect should provide
%% comprehensive documentation and training resources for users to
%% learn about AI software and best practices for using it
%% effectively.
